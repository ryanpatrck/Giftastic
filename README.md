Week 6 Homework Assignment: Giftastic Movies

•    I created an app to show gifs from your favorite movies
•   Here is the link to my documentation: https://github.com/ryanpatrck/Giftastic
•    I created arrays from ten of my favorite movies and made buttons out of them
•    When you click on each button 10 images are pulled from giphy and displayed on the page
•    When  you click on the image the gif plays and when you click again the gif stops playing
•    You can add buttons with your favorite movies and display them on the page.
•    The rating is shown for each gif on the page
